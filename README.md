# SIDCo
SIDCo is An Efficient Statistical-based Gradient Compression Technique for Distributed Training Systems

## Introduction
This repository contains the codes for the paper: "An Efficient Statistical-based Gradient Compression Technique for Distributed Training Systems", MLSys 2021
Key features include:
- Distributed training with gradient sparsification.
- Measurement of gradient distribution on various deep learning models including feed foward neural networks (FFNs), CNNs and LSTMs.
- A Efficient Statistical-based Gradient Compression Technique called SIDCo for Distributed Training of DNN models.

For more details about the algorithm, please refer to our papers.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 2 or 3
- PyTorch-0.4.+
- [OpenMPI-3.1.+](https://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v3.1/)
- [Horovod-0.14.+](https://github.com/horovod/horovod)
### Quick Start

## Install software
```
pip install pytorch=1.3 openmpi=4.0
https://github.com/horovod/horovod
cd horovod
git checkout tags/0.18 -b master
HOROVOD_GPU_ALLREDUCE=NCCL pip install --no-cache-dir horovod (optional if horovod has been installed)
```

## Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt    #all python libraries including pytorch and openmpi

sudo apt-get install libsndfile1   #for librosa

git clone https://github.com/SeanNaren/warp-ctc.git   # for AN4 dataset
cd warp-ctc
mkdir build; cd build
cmake ..
make
cd ../pytorch_binding
python setup.py install
```

## Running the experiments
```
git clone https://github.com/ahmedcs/sidco.git
cd sidco
dnn=resnet20 nworkers=4 compressor=topk density=0.001 ./run8.sh
```
Assume that you have 8 nodes with 1 GPUs each (update the file clusters/cluster8 for IP configurations) and everything works well, you will see that there are 8 workers running at a single node training the ResNet-20 model with the Cifar-10 data set using SGD with top-k sparsification. Note that dnn=resnet20 will invoke the config file resnet20.conf in the exp_configs folder which contains settings of training hyper-parameters.

Before running the experiment, please make sure the datasets are downloaded and the path to data_dir is properly set in exp_configs folder which contain a config file for each DNN model.

## Running the benchmark experiments
Generate the gradient vectors of different iterations and store them as a numpy array (.npy) in the grads folder. Check the naming in the run_microbench.sh file of the files or update them accordingly.
Then, run the run_microbench.sh script to get microbenchmark results both on CPU and GPU for various gradients stored in the grads folder. 
There is also a microbenchmark that does not require pre-generation of the gradients vector as it relies on synthetic vectors which can be ran using run_microbench_randn.sh.
